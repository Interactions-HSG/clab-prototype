== Design ==
Designer -> CAD: Creat a new design
note right
  * Goal: create fashion optimized with respect to CE and sustainability
  ** Data that might be relevant for this goal
  ** Different fabric blocks type might have different statistics
  *** due to different wear/teat, Farbechtheit
end note
Designer --> CAD: Design "Crop Top"
note right: Designer uses the Refashion method to create circular fashion

== Information Gathering  ==

alt Design

    CAD -> CAD : Synthesize recipe

    note right
    Although based on Refashion, Designers might take shortcuts
    e.g. cut and sew instead of folding. This might behandled by a plugin to the CAD system
    end note

    CAD -> ProductCookbook : Append recipe
    ProductCookbook --> CAD : Product ID

end

CAD -> CEIS : Send product ID. Expect Designer-facing information.
note right : CEIS needs to find out what are the possible ways to assemble the requested product. This is a list of BoMs and BoPs
CAD --> CEIS: Fetch info on "Crop Top"
CEIS -> ProductCookbook: Request Recipies (Input Materials, Production Recipie) possibilities to create product.
CEIS --> ProductCookbook: Recipies for "Crop Top"
ProductCookbook -> CEIS: List of (Input Materials, Production Recipie)
note right: The Cookbook delivers possibilities of how the product can be procured.
ProductCookbook --> CEIS: [((2x FabricBlock1, 1x FabricBlock2), (Mark&Align, Sew, Sew, Fold, Sew, Sew, Fold, Fold, Sew))]

== Analysis of Manufacturing Options ==
alt Design
    note right : CEIS now needs to determine how the Input Materials might be reduced
    CEIS -> MaterialFlowMonitor: Request availability of input materials.
    note right: Could include further metadata, e.g. quality thresholds, wear&tear, etc.
    CEIS --> MaterialFlowMonitor: (2x FabricBlock1, 1x FabricBlock2, Deadline)
    MaterialFlowMonitor -> CEIS: List of options for each input material procurable within deadline, with quality metric
    note right
    Quality metric is one-dimensional. NEW at 100%; UNUSABLE at 0%.
    **Also a designer might be interested in other meta data like return rights, lifetime of fabric blocks, etc**
    end note
    MaterialFlowMonitor --> CEIS: (FabricBlock1: 90%; FabricBlock1: 86%; FabricBlock1: 70%; FabricBlock2: 70%; FabricBlock2: 95%)
end
CEIS -> CEIS:
note right: CEIS now knows about available materials
note right: CEIS adds alternatives to list of possibilities. The resulting possibilities are in list SUST-POSS
CEIS -> CostAnalyzer: Forach alternative: fetch economical, ecological and social costs
CostAnalyzer -> WISER: Request GHG impact of each possibility in SUST-POSS
WISER --> CostAnalyzer: GHG
CostAnalyzer -> ERP: Request costs for each possibility in SUST-POSS
ERP --> CostAnalyzer: Prices
CostAnalyzer -> CEIS: costs for each alternative
CostAnalyzer --> CEIS: [1:{(CO2eq: 33 kgCO2, Water: 300l), (Price), (ContributionLocalInitiatives: 60$)}, 2:{...}]
CEIS --> CAD: alternatives, costs
== Negotation ==
' CAD -> CAD: Match alternatives with company policies
CAD --> Designer : Present alternatives to the Designer
Designer -> CAD : (Adjust and) Confirm design
note right : Designers may decide for one or more alternatives
CAD -> ProductCookbook : Update recipe
ProductCookbook --> CAD : Operation status
CAD --> Designer : Show operation status


' == Realization ==
' CAD -> CEIS: Event: order
' CEIS -> ProcessControl: alternatives, deadlines
' ProcessControl -> ProcessControl: Schedule processes
' ProcessControl -> ProcessControl: Monitor Processes
' note right: The processes may include internal and external for contract fullfilment
' ProcessControl -> MaterialFlowMonitor: Inform about results
' note right: Noteworthy results might be the completion of a new product and loss
' ProcessControl -> CEIS: Informs about actual costs
' CEIS -> DigitalProductPassport: Update data
