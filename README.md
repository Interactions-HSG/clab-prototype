# clab-prototype

The prototypes for the circular lab consists of a set of prototypes that eventually will act together as complete system. To explore the current state, visit:

- [clab-ceis](https://github.com/Interactions-HSG/clab-ceis)
- [clab-recipe-synth](https://github.com/Interactions-HSG/clab-recipe-synthesis)

## How to explore

Currently the prototypes are not connected, hence they will be presented separately

### CEIS

- [Shop](http://localhost:8050/)
- [CEIS](http://localhost:8051/)

## Architecture

The overall idea is presented by the following diagram:

## Recap

This repository presents our idea of a system that facilitates a circular economoy

### CEIS

A web shop that interacts with Circular Economy Information System (CEIS) and a monitor to CEIS

- Underlying Product Life Cycle Model​
- Draft of type and structure of events that could occur​
- Web shops shows how information can be produced and consumed by other systems and users​

In the Diagram​

- Placement of other work packages around CEIS (Interactions of Autonomous Agents with each other and their environment​
- A1a: Automated synthesis of manufacturing recipes for garments​
- A1b: Design and map out a manufacturing facility (microfactory)​
- A2a: Design and implementation of the CEIS and its instantiation for Refashion​
- A2b: Design and implementation of a connector of the CEIS with a lifecycle GHG emissions tracking​
- A2c: Design and development of a laboratory prototype for automated fabric block and garment assessment
